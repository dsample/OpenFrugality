Main aims of the project:
- Establish a microformat standard for community recycling programmes to share information
- Create a platform for hosting any number of local communities (from a single community to a global 'hub')

Some basic technical requirements
- Ensure the system is easy to install for non-technical administrators, requiring no specialised software to be installed on the hosting environment besides the chosen scripting language.
- To enable the greatest ease of integration, a RESTful approach will be taken
- Open standards such as OpenID and OAuth should be utilised as much as possible so that development doesn't have to start from scratch.
- (Preferably before coding starts) architectural designs should be documented and where possible reviewed.
